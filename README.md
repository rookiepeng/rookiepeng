## Hi there üëã

I‚Äôm Dr. **Zhengyu Peng**, a senior radar systems engineer with expertise in cutting-edge radar technology. I earned my Ph.D. from Texas Tech University in 2018, and since then, my focus has been on advancing high-resolution imaging radar at **Aptiv**, a global leader in safer, more sustainable mobility solutions. My technical strengths lie in **automotive radar**, **mm-wave and microwave systems**, **radar signal processing**, **antenna arrays**, and **beamforming**.

I also serve as an **Associate Editor** for the IEEE *Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement* and actively contribute to the **SPIE Defense+Commercial Sensing Radar Sensor Technology Committee**.
